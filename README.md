# Command Line Arcade

This app is a collection of three games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4, Hangman) that
use only the terminal. I created these games to practice C++ and really enjoyed
both the learning experience and the final result so I decided to share.

## Notes:

* The app uses basic C++ libraries and should compile on any platform.
* The Makefile included is simple and uses clang++. Edit to your preference.
* The Words.txt file needs to be in the same place as the app for Hangman to work.
* App was written in Xcode and tested on Mac only so far.
* Did not know Github accepted executables but one is included. **COMPILED ON MAC, USE AT OWN RISK.**

## TODO:

- [ ] AI for Connect 4.
- [ ] Add a save feature.
- [ ] Add more games.
